# Fuzzy Covid-19 infection detection
The desire to better understand and teach difficult and important process of medical diagnosis has prompted attempts to model it with the use of fuzzy sets. These models vary in the degree to which they attempt to deal with different complicating aspects of medical diagnosis such as the relative importance of symptoms, the varied symptom patterns of different disease stages, relations between diseases themselves, and the stages of hypothesis information, preliminary diagnosis, and final diagnosis within the diagnostic process itself. These models also form the basis for computerized medical expert systems, which are usually designed to aid the physician in the diagnosis of some specified category of diseases. In this project, we utilize fuzzy methods to implement a system for detecting COVID-19 infections.
